# CPU💻
Here are some CPU designs you want 😇

### Info

The designs of the cpu written by Verilog. 

And you' ll need to have a FPGA board to test the design in real world.

1. CPU31
   * MIPS instruction set
   * harvard architecture
   * single-cycle CPU 
2. CPU54
   * MIPS instruction set
   * harvard architecture
   * multi-cycle CPU 

### Directory
