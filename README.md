# CPU💻
Here are some CPU designs you want 😇

### Information

The designs of the cpu written by Verilog. 

And you' ll need to have a FPGA board to test the design in real world.

1. CPU31
   * MIPS instruction set
   * harvard architecture
   * single-cycle CPU 
2. CPU54
   * MIPS instruction set
   * harvard architecture
   * multi-cycle CPU 

### Environment
  * Vivado 2016.2

### Directory

* CPU31

  all of the files to design a cpu with 31 instructions

* CPU54

  all of the files to design a cpu with 54 instructions
